            Today is saturday, <span class="highlight">first lesson of the Web Development classes.</span> 
            Lecture was more <span class="highlight">general</span> and <span class="highlight">
            Teacher gave us a laboratory work on HTML and CSS.</span> 
            We had to study it ourselves. There were 2 big subtasks. First from Khan academy and
            second from Udacity. Each had big amount of subsubtasks as-well.
            I'm doing it right now and I can say I'm doing not
            bad. Already learn more <span class="highlight">HTML tags and CSS selectors</span>, will continue advancing.

        <p class="content">
            After <span class="highlight">Web Development</span> class we immediately had
            an <span class="highlight">ICT class.</span> Most of students of other 
            specialties and even of <span class="highlight">related specialties</span> 
            like IS and AC already studied it. They were learning <span class="highlight">
            Python programming language</span> from very beginning which is strange since 
            we already had Python at our PP2 class. So we were exprecting Python too. 
            But surprisingly we did not have Python as a main PL, instead we had 
            <span class="highlight">C#!!!</span> I knew how powerful this language is and 
            knowing that I will study it made me really happy. It's very similar to 
            <span class="highlight">Java</span> but even more powerful. Will try to 
            master even if my future professor doesn't seem to be related to it.
